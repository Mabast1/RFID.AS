### RFID based Attendance System

Team Leader: Mabast Ahmad 

**Brief Project Description:**


Attendance in colleges is generally paper based which may sometimes cause errors. 
Taking attendance manually consumes more time. So the proposed attendance system uses RFID technology to take attendance. 
In this system, each student is issued an RFID tag.
Controlling unit is in the institute. Whenever the card is placed near the reader, it will take the attendance.
